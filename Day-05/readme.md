### Functions in PHP

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task .They help make code more modular, maintainable, and readable

#### • Types of Functions in PHP

 • User-defined Functions
 • Anonymous Functions
 • Arrow Functions
 • Built-in Functions

### User- defind Functions:

These are functions that you explicitly define in your PHP code to perform specific tasks. You create them using the `function` keyword, optionally with parameters and return values.

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are functions without a specified name. They are often used as callbacks or assigned to variables. They can also capture variables from the surrounding scope using the `use` keyword.

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for anonymous functions, especially useful for simple expressions. They automatically capture variables from the parent scope.

### Built-in Functions

PHP comes with a vast set of built-in functions covering everything from string manipulation, array handling, file operations, to date/time processing and more. These functions are ready to use without needing to define them.
