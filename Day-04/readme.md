### Loops in PHP

• Loops in PHP are used to execute a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met.
 • There are four main types of loops in PHP

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. foreach loop
   1.While loop : The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown It runs as long as the condition remains true.
   2.Do-while loop :The do-while loop executes at least once, even if the condition is false  This is useful when you want to execute the loop body before checking the condition.
   3.for loop : The for loop is best suited for iterating a fixed number of times
   4.for each loop: The foreach is designed for iterating over arrays and objects
   Loop control statemnts are break and continue.
   a.The break Statements:
   Terminates the loop immediately
   b.The continue Statements:
   Skips the remaining code in the loop for the current ,iteration and moves to the next iteration
