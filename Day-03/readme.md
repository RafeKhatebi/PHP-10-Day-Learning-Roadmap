   ### Conditional Statements

   • Conditional statements in PHP control the flow of execution based on given conditions
   • They allow us to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false
   • PHP provides the following conditional statements:
   • if Statement
   • if-else Statement
   • if-elseif-else Statement
   • switch Statement
   • Ternary Operator (?:)
   • Null Coalescing Operator (??)
